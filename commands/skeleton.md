# Create Skeleton Component

Create a skeleton loading state that mirrors the target component’s layout to prevent layout shift.

**Component:** The user must provide the component to skeletonize (e.g. file path or clear reference). If they have not provided it, ask them for it before proceeding.

**How to do it:** Use the **achra-guidelines** skill (`@.cursor/skills/achra-guidelines`) and follow its Skeleton loading section and linked references.
